# Hello, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

## My Programming Journey ðŸŒŸ

I am a self-taught programmer whose journey began with a curiosity to understand how software works. This curiosity led me to delve into the world of programming, starting with Python and exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) using NLTK. My path then took me to Data Analytics, where I learned to harness the power of libraries like pandas and matplotlib, and skills such as data collection, API integration, and data cleaning.

This foundation paved the way for my venture into supervised machine learning, where I became proficient in regression models, classification models, decision trees, matrices, and XGBoost. My discovery of Kaggle further fueled my passion and knowledge in the field.

Taking a step back from coding, I immersed myself in electronics, learning about microcontrollers, IoT, ESP32, and Arduino, which introduced me to C++. The CS50x course on edX was a turning point, as it deepened my understanding of C programming and the intricacies that were abstracted away in Python.

I also revisited my roots in web development, building upon my knowledge of HTML and CSS from two decades ago. I embarked on Flask projects and web application development, which led me to learn Git and GitHub. My journey continued with Django, as I began creating web apps with this powerful framework.

Now, after 18 months of dedicated learning and gaining a solid understanding of programming and languages, I find myself able to pick up new languages with much greater ease.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and more about advanced web development techniques I've also been diving deeper into the nuances of C to enhance my skill set.
